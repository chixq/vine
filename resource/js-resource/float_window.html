    This is an incredibly annoying ad of the type you might find on some web sites.

I am honored to be with you today at your commencement from one of the finest universities in the world. I never graduated form college.
True be told, this is the closest I’ve ever gotten to a college graduation. Today I wan to tell you
three stories from my life. That’s it.  No big deal. Just three stories. 
</p> 
<p> 
The first story is about connecting the dots. 
I dropped out of Reed College after the first 6 months, but then stayed around as a drop-in for 
another 18 months or so before I really quit. So why did I drop out? 
It started before I was born.  My biological mother was a young, unwed college graduate student, 
and she decided to put me up for adoption. She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by 
college graduates, so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his 
wife.Except that when I popped out they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl.
So my parents, who were on a waiting list, got a call in the middle of the night asking:”We have an
unexpected baby boy; do you want him?” They said:”Of course.” My biological mother later found out
that my mother had never graduated from college and that my father had never graduated from high 
school. She refused to sign the final adoption papers. She only relented a few months later when 
my parents promised that I would someday go to college.
